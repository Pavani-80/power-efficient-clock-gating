# Power-Efficient Clock Gating Module (Verilog)

This project implements a simple enable-based clock gating module in Verilog to reduce dynamic power consumption in synchronous digital circuits. Clock gating is a widely used low-power technique in VLSI and digital design, where the clock signal to unused modules is disabled (gated) to save power.

Why Clock Gating?

The clock network consumes a significant portion of the total dynamic power in digital chips.

By selectively turning off the clock signal when a module is idle, we prevent unnecessary switching activity.

This project demonstrates how to use a latch-based enable signal to gate the clock signal safely without glitches.
